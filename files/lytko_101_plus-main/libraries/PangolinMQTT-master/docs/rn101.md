# Release Notes v1.0.1

---

# Bug Fixes

Fixed bizarre edge case where no error is generated if an attempt is made to connect with no details (i.e. setServer has not been called but connect is called anyway)
Fixed minor display errors in example sketches error handling

---

# New features

New error type NO_SERVER_DETAILS (value 11) (see bug fixes)

---

# Changes

## Breaking

The version of `setServer(IPAddress,uint16_t)` taking an `IPAddress` has been removed.
This is an optimisation to reduce code size: using the version which takes a character string `setServer(const char* host, uint16_t port)`
works perfectly well when the string is a valid "dotted quad" IP address e.g. "192.168.1.4" and is more effficient

## Non-breaking

* Minor internal tweak to assist optimisation in [H4Plugins v1.0.0](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins)
* A tweak has been made to the timing of PINGREQ messages - it is hoped that this may solve the problem of not getting a "server gone away" while sending a rapid stream of messages, even when the server had genuinely gone away
* Examples modified to show new error message
* Examples modified to use text value for server as IPAddress version now removed
