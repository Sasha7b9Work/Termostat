# Bug Fixes

Not necessarily a bug in PangolinMQT *per se*, but affected by an underlying bug in [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/philbowles/ESPAsyncTCP-master). You will need to re-download it from that link (Do ***NOT*** use the original!).

Some minor code changes have been made to avoid (yet) another issue with [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/philbowles/ESPAsyncTCP-master). For the same reason, in your own code, you must NOT try to reconnect within (about) 20 seconds of a previous attempt. This figure appears to be hardcoded into the 8266 LwIP implementation so there is little that can be done about it.

The following symptom will occur if your connection retry time T is less than the LwIP / system hardcoded Abort timeout:

1. If you reconnect successfully within the first T, the library will simply carry on from where it left off.
2. If more than 1x T period elapses between disconnect and successful reconnect (***and*** T < LwIP ABRT timout, don't forget> then you will get an immediate disconnect after any subsequent connect and the cycle will repeat endlessly.

The workaround is simple: keep you vakue of T > than the LwIP / system hardcoded Abort timeout. On ESP8266 core 2.7.4 / LwIP 2 its 20000 mS = 20seconds. Set yous to 25 or greater to be safe. If the problem persists just keep increasing your on retry time till the problem disappears.
